</li></ul>
<br>
<h3>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

In Short: We may process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.
<br>
We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:
<br>
<ul><li><strong>To save or protect an individual's vital interest</strong>. We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individualâ€™s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li></ul>

<h3>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations or to protect your rights.
<br>

      <h3>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.
<br>
We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
<ul><li>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of our assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li></ul>

<h3>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
<br>
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).
<br>
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
<br>
<h3>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>

In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.
<br>
Since we do not collect any information, it is not possible for us to keep or delete your information. The data you provide stays inside your device unless you explicitely share it with others. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

<h3>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

<br>
Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.
<br>
However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
<br>
If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:vmaahi46@gmail.com">vmaahi46@gmail.com</a>.
<br>
<h3>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
